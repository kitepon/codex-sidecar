# Canonical Overview

`codex-sidecar` is a pnpm monorepo that runs Codex as a controlled sidecar for
reviews, codebase exploration, risk checks, structured generation, and scoped
work inside isolated git worktrees.

The completed 0.3.6 release added workflow-specific closed output schemas with
a Codex App Server 0.144.1 preflight while preserving `generate`'s
caller-owned object/array output contract. The completed 0.3.7 patch makes
factory diagnostics safely launch the npm-installed MCP command on Windows.
The completed 0.3.8 release repairs complete JSON-producing CLI stdout handling
for large diagnostics output and `EPIPE`.

The completed 0.3.5 release record is archived at
[RELEASE_0_3_5_PLAN.md](RELEASE_0_3_5_PLAN.md). The completed 0.3.4
CLI/MCP version contract and release record is archived at
[CLI_VERSION_PLAN.md](CLI_VERSION_PLAN.md).
The completed 0.3.7 Windows command-shim release record is archived at
[WINDOWS_MCP_SHIM_PLAN.md](WINDOWS_MCP_SHIM_PLAN.md).
The completed 0.3.8 JSON stdout integrity and release record is archived at
[plan_factory-diagnostics-output-integrity.md](plan_factory-diagnostics-output-integrity.md).

## Layout Standard Status

This repository follows the PROJECT_LAYOUT A-monorepo shape: root agent docs,
`docs/`, `rag/`, `packages/`, `examples/`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and shared
TypeScript config. Current generated and local-only state stays out of git via
`.gitignore`.
